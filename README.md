# Hot Auto-Claim Bot

This Python script simplifies claiming the cryptocurrency HOT, using the "HereWalletBot" app, a free-to-use application on Telegram that is also Web3 enabled on the NEAR Protocol blockchain. The app requires frequent logins to claim tokens to maximize accumulating the most rewards. This script automates these actions, guaranteeing the maximum accumulation of HOT tokens by executing the claim sequence once the wallet is full. Should the wallet not be filled, it calculates the time until completion and waits to claim, thus optimizing both network usage and lowering your Gas Fees.

ðŸ’¡ **TIP:** You can claim on multiple HereWallet accounts using a single Telegram account, provided you use an individual session for each account using SCREEN or an alternative, as described below. Each time you scan a QR Code or enter a One-Time Password (OTP), it counts as one login attempt. Attempting to log into a single Telegram account more than 20 times in 24 hours is considered "flooding" by Telegram, and they will apply a 24-hour cooldown on further login attempts. However, once logged in, you will stay logged in unless you exit the script.

## ðŸš€ How To Use (installation based on Ubuntu 20.04/22.04)

### Linux Users - Quick Start (or follow the manual steps below)
#### Install GitHub (if necessary), fetch this repository, run the install script!

- VPS users should make an SSH connection via PuTTy or open the Command Window on your local machine.

   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y git || true && git clone https://github.com/Mantodkaz/hot.git && cd hot && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
   ```
Start your first session with ```screen -S first_session```. If you are not in the hot directory, you must ```cd hot```. Execute the Python script using ```python3 hot.py```, then follow the [Usage Notes](#usage-notes) to set up the session and automate the claiming process. Pressing ```CTRL+A+D``` simultaneously will leave this session running in the background. ```screen -r first_session``` will resume the session for you to check on progress, or for errors. 

If you have a second account, from the command line (not within the first Screen), start another session with ```screen -S second_session``` and execute the Python script ```python3 hot.py```. You may now run another instance of ```python3 hot.py``` to log into the second account. You can exit Screen and leave the script unattended by pressing ```CTRL+A+D```. ```screen -r second_session``` will resume the session for you to check on progress, or for errors. 

ðŸ’¡ Tip: Each screen session consumes approximately 450 MB of server memory. The total number of sessions you can run is limited by your server's physical RAM. To maximize usage, you can add sessions up to the point where memory is nearly utilized. Executing ```sudo reboot``` clears all active sessions and releases memory once the operating system reboots, providing a quick way to refresh your system resources.

### Linux Manual installation - Ensure each command in the code block executes. 

1. **Install Python & PIP:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip
   python3 --version   
   ```
2. **Download & Install the Chrome `.deb` package:**

   ```bash
   wget -O /tmp/chrome.deb https://mirror.cs.uchicago.edu/google-chrome/pool/main/g/google-chrome-stable/google-chrome-stable_114.0.5735.198-1_amd64.deb
   sudo apt install -y /tmp/chrome.deb
   rm /tmp/chrome.deb   
   ```
3. **Download & Install Chromedriver:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y unzip
   wget https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/114.0.5735.90/chromedriver_linux64.zip
   unzip chromedriver_linux64.zip
   rm chromedriver_linux64.zip
   sudo mv chromedriver /usr/local/bin/
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/chromedriver
   chromedriver --version   
   ```
4. **Clone this repository:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y git
   git clone https://github.com/Mantodkaz/hot.git   
   ```
5. **Switch to the repository directory:**
   ```bash
   cd hot   
   ```
6. **Install the dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install selenium Pillow   
   ```
7. **Start a Screen Session for Unattended Access & execute the Python script:**
   ```bash
   screen -S yourSessionName
   python3 hot.py   
   ```
   - You can exit the screen session by pressing ```CTRL+A+D``` simultaneously, it will remain running in the background for unattended claims, provided you successfully log in.
   - You can resume an active screen session with ```screen -r yourSessionName```

## Usage Instructions

#### After executing the script with python3 claim.py, the process flow is as follows:

1. **Force Claim on First Run:** Enter `y` to force a claim even if the wallet isn't full; otherwise, simply press `<Enter>` to skip.
2. **Enable Debugging:** Type `y` to activate debugging, which saves process screenshots for review. Press `<Enter>` to keep debugging off (default).
3. **QR Code Login Option:** Want to log in by scanning a QR code? Press `<Enter>`, or type `n` to proceed with your phone number and OTP.
4. **Session Name Configuration:**
   - Press `<Enter>` to assign a default session name of ascending numeric values (1, 2, 3, etc.).
   - Alternatively, you can enter your value (JohnDoes_Wallet, myWallet1, etc).
   - If restarting the script after stopping it, you may want to re-use a previous Session Name to keep the screenshots in the same location.
5. **Country Name for Telegram:**
   - Input your Country Name exactly as listed on [Telegram's login page](https://web.telegram.org/k/), like "USA" or "UNITED KINGDOM".
   - As a shortcut, pressing `<Enter>` attempts to select the corresponding Country Name based on your internet connection IP address.
   - If your IP address location differs from your registered phone number location, you MUST specify it explicitly. 
6. **Phone Number Entry:** Omit the initial "0" from your phone number when prompted.
7. **One-Time Password (OTP)**: Enter the One-Time Password that has been sent to your Telegram Messaging Account.
8. **Seed Phrase Input for HereWallet Login:** Your seed phrase remains private, with script transparency ensuring security. Ensure your phrase consists of exactly 12 words, spaced correctly without punctuation or numbers.

After following these steps, if all inputs are correctly entered, and assuming no flooding block is in place, you'll successfully logged into both Telegram and HereWallet.
